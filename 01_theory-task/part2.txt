2. Data Collection Strategy
• How would you collect and store information on all European airports (including IATA code,
ICAO code, country, etc.)?
• Suggest methods for gathering real-time flight data. You may propose using ChatGPT API
for scraping, ADB data, or third-party APIs like FlightAware.
• Explain how you would handle missing, delayed, or inconsistent data.


## Collecting European Airport Information:

### Third-Party APIs:

- OurAirports database (open-source)
- OpenFlights database
- Aviation Edge Airport API


### Implementation Method:

- Create an initial seed script to populate the database
- Schedule periodic (monthly) updates to check for new airports or changes
- Store changelog for auditing purposes



## Real-time Flight Data Collection:

### Direct API Integration:

- AviationStack API (good balance of features and cost)
- OpenSky Network API (free but limited)


### Web Scraping with ChatGPT API:

- Use GPT-4 with Function Calling to extract structured data from airport websites
- Create custom scrapers for major airports' websites
- Implement a queue system to manage scraping requests



## For handling inconsistent data:

### Data Validation Pipeline:

- Implement validation rules to identify anomalies
- Cross-reference data from multiple sources when available
- Flag suspicious or incomplete entries for human review


### Reconciliation Process:

- Compare scheduled vs. actual timestamps
- Use a scoring system to determine data reliability
- Implement automated correction for known data issues


### Missing Data Handling:

- Define fallback sources for each data point
- Implement interpolation techniques for missing timestamps
- Clearly mark estimated vs. actual data points
