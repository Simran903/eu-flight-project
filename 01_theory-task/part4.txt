4. Future API Development
• Describe how you would design and implement a scalable API to provide flight data across
Europe on a daily basis.
• Suggest how you would ensure API security, availability, and reliability

## API Design:

### API Architecture:

- RESTful API with GraphQL option for complex queries
- Microservices architecture to separate concerns:

- Airport Information Service
- Flight Status Service
- Delay Monitoring Service
- Historical Data Service


### Technical Implementation:

- Use API Gateway (like AWS API Gateway or Kong) for routing and rate limiting
- Implement versioning from day one (e.g., /v1/flights)
- Design for backward compatibility



## Security, Availability, and Reliability:

### Security Measures:

- OAuth 2.0 with JWT for authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and parameterized queries
- Regular security audits and penetration testing


### Availability Strategy:

- Multi-region deployment
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures


### Reliability Features:

- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Detailed logging with ELK stack
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Regular disaster recovery testing
